# General
* Code written for [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* I seems near the [RCP217 at the CNAM institute](https://formation.cnam.fr/rechercher-par-discipline/intelligence-artificielle-pour-des-donnees-multimedia-1132537.kjsp?RF=) which is part of the [IA certifcation](https://formation.cnam.fr/rechercher-par-discipline/certificat-de-specialisation-intelligence-artificielle-1176377.kjsp) that I follow there  
# Where is the source code for the book
* There is a [GitHub project](https://github.com/krishnonwork/mathematical-methods-in-deep-learning-ipython) for the code
* The [README.md](https://github.com/krishnonwork/mathematical-methods-in-deep-learning-ipython/blob/master/README.md) explains how to install all for PyTorch and the Jupiter Notebooks
  * (all goes through a [requirement.txt file](https://github.com/krishnonwork/mathematical-methods-in-deep-learning-ipython/blob/master/requirements.txt) to be run in a virtualenv environment)
  * I will run that in my WSL
